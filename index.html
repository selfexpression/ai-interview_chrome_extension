            <span>1. Can you explain how you would optimize the performance of a React application, specifically

            <div class="hint">To optimize a React application using functional components and hooks, I would:

              1. **Use `React.memo`**: Wrap functional components with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
              when props
              haven't changed.
              2. **Optimize hooks**: Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations and `useCallback` for memoizing functions
              to avoid
              recreating them on every render.
              3. **Lazy loading**: Implement `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for code-splitting to load components only when
              needed,
              reducing the initial bundle size.
              4. **Avoid unnecessary state updates**: Ensure state updates are only triggered when necessary to minimize
              re-renders.

              These strategies help improve performance by reducing re-renders and optimizing resource usage.</div>
